We propose DRDnet, a unified framework that synergistically integrates dual auxiliary cues and advanced relation modeling. Specifically, our Dual-Stream Disentanglement (DSD) module leverages textual descriptions and parsing images to decouple clothing factors through high-level semantic supervision and pixel-level operations, yielding robust clothing-agnostic features. Simultaneously, our Modal Relation Modeling (MRM) module constructs feature memory banks and employs adaptive soft label smoothing, effectively enhancing image-text semantic alignment and reinforcing identity consistency across clothing changes. We evaluate DRDnet on several CC-ReID benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks.\
See our paper for full details. \

We present part of the code, and the complete code will be uploaded upon paper acceptance.
